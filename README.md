**Synopsis:**

You just got a job at a fun new start up called "Zoomies".  
Zoomies provides a video call software advertised to automatically center the client's camera... At least that's what they say.
Your job, to manually correct the position of the clients' camera as fast as possible.
If you're too slow you will be noticed, which will be bad for the company and, mostly, for you.
